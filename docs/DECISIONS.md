## ADR-000: Kickoff decisions (2026-09-16)

**Context.** Neer asked for a Rust hobby/HPR rocket simulator: library first, validation-heavy,
offline-first, open source. It replaces his Loft project (TypeScript/Next.js), which he is shutting
down.

**Decision.**

- **Language and layout:** Rust, in a workspace of focused crates (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- **Order of work:** physics core and validation first; interop, bindings and analysis next; UI
  last.
- **License:** `MIT OR Apache-2.0`. MIT matches the other Fusion Space projects; Apache-2.0 adds
  a patent grant and is the Rust norm. ADR-001 confirms this in M0.1.
- **Clean room:** no GPL/AGPL source is read or ported. GPL tools may be run as external oracles.
- **No AI traces** in commits, PRs, code or docs. Commits are authored as Neer's GitHub noreply
  identity.
- **Private data:** `loft-fixtures` content is never committed; only derived statistics are
  published.
- **Name:** `hpr-sim` for now.
- **Scope:** COTS solid motors only.
- **Hosting:** a public GitHub repo (`nrdptel/hpr-sim`). Work ships through PRs; CI covers macOS,
  Windows and Linux; merging on green is pre-authorized.
- **How work runs:** unattended cycles, one milestone each, handing off through `STATUS.md`
  (see `docs/AUTOPILOT.md`).

**Consequences.**

- Work is slower at first, but every number is defensible.
- A few formats (`.CDX1`, parts of `.ork` 1.12) must be learned from samples rather than from
  source code.
- Publishing to crates.io or PyPI waits for Neer.

## ADR-001: License and workspace layout (2026-09-17)

**Context.** M0.1 turns ADR-000's provisional license and the crate map in `ARCHITECTURE.md` into
files and checks: license texts, a dependency-license policy that backs the clean-room rule, and a
workspace whose pure core can be verified.

**Decision.**

- **License:** `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, confirmed. MIT matches the other Fusion Space projects,
  Apache-2.0 adds an explicit patent grant, and the pair is the Rust norm. `LICENSE-MIT`
  (copyright "Neer Patel and the hpr-sim contributors") and `LICENSE-APACHE` (the canonical
  apache.org text, sha256 `cfc7749b96f63bd31c3c42b5c471bf756814053e847c10f3eb003417bc523d30`).
  Every crate inherits `license` from `[workspace.package]`; the README carries the usual
  dual-license contribution clause.
- **Dependency licenses (`deny.toml`):** only permissive licenses are allowed: 0BSD, Apache-2.0
  (also WITH LLVM-exception), BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, BSL-1.0, CC0-1.0,
  CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (the data license of `webpki-roots`, which rustls needs), ISC, MIT, MIT-0,
  Unicode-3.0, Unlicense and Zlib. Everything else is rejected, weak copyleft (LGPL, MPL, EPL)
  included; widening the list, or a per-crate exception, needs a new ADR. Security and unsound
  advisories and yanked versions fail anywhere in the graph. Unmaintained notices fail only for
  direct dependencies: picking maintained crates is our call, and a notice deep in the graph must
  not block unrelated PRs in unattended runs. crates.io is the only allowed source. CI pins
  cargo-deny to the version `deny.toml` was tested with (0.20.2). Checked on 2026-09-17: a
  throwaway workspace with GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1 and MPL-2.0 crates fails
  `cargo deny check licenses` (exit 4), and its MIT crate passes.
- **Layout:** a virtual workspace (resolver 3, edition 2024) with `rust-version` equal to the
  toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.98.1); bump the two together. The 17 crates of the crate map live under
  `crates/`, and their internal dependency edges are declared now, so the layering holds from the
  start. `xtask` sits at the root (`xtask/`), where the cargo-xtask convention puts it, because it
  is tooling rather than product. Crates start at 0.1.0 with `publish = false` until Neer decides
  on publishing.
- **Pure core:** a crate joins it with `[package.metadata.hpr] wasm = true`. Members: `hpr-core`,
  `hpr-atmos`, `hpr-motor`, `hpr-design`, `hpr-aero`, `hpr-sim`, `hpr-analysis`,
  `hpr-flightdata`, `hpr-format`, `hpr-io`, the `hpr` facade with default features (`net` is an
  optional feature) and `hpr-wasm`. Outside it: `hpr-net` (network and cache I/O),
  `hpr-validate` (reads case files), `hpr-cli`, `hpr-py`, `hpr-ffi` and `xtask`.
  `cargo xtask wasm-check` enforces it in two steps. First, no workspace crate outside the core
  may appear in the core's normal dependency graph for any target, as resolved by `cargo tree`
  (so features one pure crate enables in another count). Second,
  `cargo clippy --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings` on the core. Compiling for wasm32
  does not rule out I/O (`std::fs` and `Instant::now` compile and then fail at run time), so
  `clippy.toml` also disallows the filesystem, network, clock, thread, process and environment
  APIs everywhere. Crates outside the core allow those two lints at the crate root. A unit test
  pins the membership list, so changing it is visible in review.
- **Lints:** `missing_docs`, `missing_debug_implementations` and `unsafe_code = "deny"` for rustc;
  `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `print_stdout`, `print_stderr`,
  `allow_attributes_without_reason`, `dbg_macro`, `todo` and `unimplemented` for clippy.
  `clippy.toml` relaxes the panic and print lints in tests, and binaries allow printing at the
  crate root. CI fails on warnings in clippy (Linux host and wasm32), rustdoc, and the macOS and
  Windows test builds.
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` checks text out with LF everywhere, so formatting, snapshot
  tests and reference-data hashes behave the same on Windows.
- **CI:** one workflow on every PR and on pushes to `main`. fmt, clippy, doc, wasm-check and deny
  run on Linux; tests run on Linux, macOS and Windows. Swatinem/rust-cache caches builds;
  cargo-deny is installed as a prebuilt binary.

**Consequences.**

- The CLI binary is named `hpr`, like the facade library, so its rustdoc is off (`doc = false`) to
  avoid an output collision in `target/doc`.
- A binding crate that needs `unsafe` must allow it item by item, with a reason.
- A dependency under MPL or LGPL needs an ADR before it can be added. Known case: `directories`
  pulls in `option-ext` (MPL-2.0), so M5.1 needs either an ADR for a scoped exception or another
  platform-paths crate.
- Tests inside the pure core that read fixture files must use `include_str!`/`include_bytes!` or
  allow the lint on that test with a reason.

## ADR-002: The reference library: lock file, fetch, verify and doctor (2026-09-17)

**Context.** Validation needs other simulators, papers, motor data and private design files on
disk, reproducibly and never committed. M0.2 asks for `cargo xtask refs fetch|verify|doctor`
driven by `validation/refs.lock.toml`.

**Decision.**

- **One lock file, four kinds of item.**
  - `[[git]]`: pinned by full commit id, optionally shallow. Existing checkouts are reused and
    moved to the pin; checkouts with local changes are never touched.
  - `[[file]]`: an immutable download pinned by sha256 (the OpenRocket jar, 11 papers and the
    RockSim `.rse` spec).
  - `[[snapshot]]`: a live API (ThrustCurve, motor.fusionspace.co) pinned by the sha256 and date
    of one capture. APIs move (the motor finder hourly), so a missing snapshot that no longer
    matches fails. The new capture is kept beside it, with a record of its URL, its hash, its
    date and the pin it drifted from. `fetch --adopt-snapshots` moves that kept capture into place
    only if the entry still has the same URL and pin and the bytes are unchanged; otherwise it
    downloads a fresh capture and says why. It then rewrites only that entry's `sha256` and
    `captured` lines, using the capture's real date.
  - `[python]`: a `uv` project in `validation/oracles/` (`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`,
    committed), installed into `refs/venv` with `uv sync --locked`. That refuses a lock that is
    stale against `pyproject.toml` and checks every artifact against the hash in `uv.lock`;
    orhelper is pinned by git commit.

  Every destination must be a plain relative path inside the gitignored `refs/`, and
  destinations may not overlap.
- **Private repositories** (`private = true`, today `loft-fixtures`) are fetched with the
  user's git credentials, never prompting. A private repository that isn't checked out and
  doesn't answer `git ls-remote` (no access, as in CI) is skipped with a note. Any other failure,
  such as a bad pin or a checkout that can't move, fails. No partial checkout is left behind. A `sha256sum` manifest in a checkout can be pinned too;
  `verify` then hashes every listed file.
- **Idempotence:** anything already in its pinned state is left alone, so a second `fetch`
  downloads nothing. Downloads go to `<dest>.part` and are renamed into place only after the hash
  matches.
- **Verify re-hashes content**, not timestamps.
  - Files are hashed with SHA-256.
  - Git checkouts are compared, byte for byte (`core.autocrlf=false`), against a fresh temporary
    index read from the pinned commit. That makes git hash every tracked file, whereas a plain
    `git status` trusts cached stat data and can miss a same-size edit; a test shows both.
    Untracked files that the repository doesn't ignore also fail.
  - The environment must pass `uv sync --locked --check`, which compares package versions only.
    Then every installed file is re-hashed against the sha256 its package's `RECORD` lists
    (4,675 files today). Any file or symlinked directory that no `RECORD` lists fails, such as a
    `sitecustomize.py` or a `.pth` file, which would run at startup. The exception is the venv's
    own scaffolding (activation scripts, interpreter links, `pyvenv.cfg`, `_virtualenv.py`),
    which is allowed by name. Its content isn't pinned, because uv generates it, except
    `_virtualenv.pth`, whose one line is checked.
    The check runs Python with `-I`, so `PYTHONPATH` and the current directory can't leak in.
    `fetch` repairs hash failures with `uv sync --reinstall --no-cache`. Files no package owns
    can't be repaired that way, so `fetch` names them and asks for them to be deleted. uv installs by copying
    (`UV_LINK_MODE=copy`), so an edited venv file can't corrupt uv's cache through a hard link.
  - Git commands drop `GIT_DIR`-style variables, so a git hook can't redirect them at this
    repository.
- **External tools instead of crates:** `git`, `curl` and `uv` are run as commands. They exist on
  all three CI operating systems, and an HTTP and TLS stack in `xtask` would add many dependencies
  for no gain. curl is restricted to `https` (and `file` for tests), redirects included, and gives
  up on a transfer that stalls below 1 kB/s for a minute. New
  `xtask` dependencies: `serde`, `toml`, `sha2`, and `tempfile` for tests.
- **Doctor** lists the tools and their versions, a quick reference check (hashes of files,
  commits of checkouts), and whether each oracle is runnable. RocketPy: `rocketpy` imports at the
  locked version. OpenRocket: Java 17+ is found (`JAVA_HOME`, macOS `java_home`, Homebrew's
  keg-only `openjdk` formulae, then `PATH`), the jar verifies, `orhelper` and `jpype` import, and
  a smoke test starts the JVM through JPype and loads the jar's `Main-Class`. The smoke test sets
  `JAVA_HOME` from the runtime's own `java.home` property, which is reliable behind shims. The smoke test uses
  JPype (Apache-2.0) directly, so no project code calls into GPL orhelper. "Runnable" therefore
  means the runtime starts, not that a flight has been simulated; the M2.x oracle scripts do that.
- **Consistency tests:** every lock item needs a row in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` with the same
  license and mode (and title, for papers), and every real URL uses `https`.
- **Source choices:** orhelper comes from `openrocket/orhelper` at a pinned commit, because PyPI's
  0.1.3 predates OpenRocket 24.12. The Knacke manual comes from archive.org's mirror of the DTIC
  copy, because DTIC refused automated downloads. It is a contractor report with a restrictive
  title-page notice, so it is labelled "unclear terms" and is never redistributed. RocketPy is a shallow clone of `v1.13.0`
  (about 390 MB, mostly ERA5 weather files that M2.3 needs).

**Consequences.**

- A fresh machine cannot reproduce a snapshot byte for byte once the API has moved; it has to
  adopt a new capture, and results that depend on it must name the capture date. Validation
  results that CI checks must come from committed fixtures, not from `refs/`.
- The `refs` tests need `git` and `curl` on the test machine. They use local `file://` sources
  and never touch the network.
- Java is not fetched: the user installs a JDK, and `doctor` says how.
- M2.2's oracle scripts will need a decision on importing GPL-2.0 orhelper from this repository,
  as opposed to driving the jar through JPype directly. This is recorded under "Needs Neer" in
  `STATUS.md`.

## ADR-003: Frames, attitude, geodesy and the gravity model (2026-09-17)

**Context.** M1.1 fixes the conventions that every later crate uses: the frames, the attitude
representation, the Earth model, and interpolation tables. Loft simulated a flat Earth with
constant 9.80665 m/s² gravity and never stated a frame. That left it 0.3% off RocketPy's gravity
at the equator (lesson L1), and its apogee datum and ground-hit frame were never defined (L35).
The comparisons in M2.1 need hpr's conventions to map exactly onto RocketPy's.

**Decision.**

- **Math types:** glam's `f64` types (`DVec3`, `DQuat`, `DMat3`) with the `f64`, `serde` and
  `std` features only. `hpr-core` re-exports them.
- **Frames** (`docs/physics/frames.md`):
  - **ECEF:** WGS 84.
  - **Launch frame `L`:** East-North-Up, origin at the pad, `z_L` along the ellipsoid normal.
    State propagates in `L`, which is Earth-fixed.
  - **Body frame `B`:** `+z_B` along the axis toward the nose, `x_B` along the design's zero
    radial direction.
  - **Attitude:** a unit Hamilton quaternion mapping body to launch components, with
    `q̇ = ½ q ⊗ (0, ω_B)` and renormalization after every step.
  - **Launch angles:** `q = R_z(−A) R_x(E − π/2) R_z(φ)`. This is RocketPy's 3-1-3 initial
    attitude with heading, inclination and rail-button angle, pinned by a RocketPy oracle
    fixture (`validation/oracles/rocketpy/attitude.py`).
  - **Rationale:** RocketPy is the main oracle, so matching its axes removes a class of sign
    errors from the comparisons. At the identity attitude the rocket stands vertical on the pad.
- **Heights:** every height in the core is ellipsoidal (`Geodetic::height_m`). Heights above sea
  level are converted at the I/O boundary. The flight engine reports altitude from the geodetic
  height of the position, not from `z_L`.
- **Geodetic conversion:** the forward conversion is NGA.STND.0036 eq. 4-14. The inverse is
  Karney's (2011, appendix B) version of Vermeille's closed form. It needs no iteration, is exact
  to rounding, and fails only within 43 km of the Earth's centre, where it returns an error.
  Bowring's iterative method was rejected: it needs an iteration count and a convergence
  tolerance, and its primary source is paywalled. Karney's paper is open.
- **Gravity:** WGS 84 normal gravity from its four defining parameters (NGA.STND.0036 ch. 4,
  app. B), with the exact ellipsoidal-harmonic closed form as the default.
  - The flight engine chooses from `constant`, `vertical_taylor` (RocketPy's), `vertical` and
    `ellipsoidal` (the default). Earth rotation contributes Coriolis only, by default. The
    centrifugal term is inside normal gravity.
  - `q` and `q′` use their `atan` series below `ε = 0.5` to avoid cancellation. That makes the
    derived constants round to Table 3.6.
  - **Rationale:** exact at every height a hobby rocket reaches, cheap enough for the inner loop
    (35.5 ns a call on the dev machine, `docs/perf.md`), and able to reproduce RocketPy's
    formula exactly when a comparison needs it.
- **Reference values:** no publication tabulates normal gravity by latitude and height.
  `validation/oracles/wgs84/normal_gravity.py` evaluates the published formulas at 40 digits with
  mpmath, which was added to the oracle environment. It checks the derived constants against the
  tables and the vector against the gradient of the normal potential. Its JSON output is committed
  under `validation/fixtures/earth/`, and the Rust tests read it with `include_str!`, so CI needs
  no Python.
- **Tables:** `Table1D` offers linear or natural-cubic interpolation, with a `clamp`, `linear` or
  `error` extrapolation policy. Every lookup reports whether it extrapolated. A monotone cubic
  waits until a model needs one (`docs/physics/interpolation.md`).
- **JSON floats:** `serde_json` has `float_roundtrip` enabled workspace-wide, so a parsed number
  is the exact `f64` that was written.

**Consequences.**

- M1.6 must:
  - use the geodetic height for ground contact and apogee;
  - decide whether its rotational dynamics include the frame rate `Ω` (at most 7.3e-5 rad/s);
  - call `Earth::gravity_enu_mps2` and `Earth::rotation_acceleration_enu_mps2` instead of a
    constant.
- M2.1 cases that compare with RocketPy select `vertical_taylor`. They must also account for
  RocketPy feeding height above sea level to its formula, and holding gravity constant above
  `max_expected_height` (80 km by default).
- M1.4 fixes the body reference point and the station mapping `z_B = z_ref − s`.

## ADR-004: Atmosphere, wind, turbulence and the seeded generator (2026-09-17)

**Context.** M1.2 builds `hpr-atmos`. Loft's atmosphere was wrong in five ways (lessons L2–L6):
geometric height fed to geopotential formulas, four layers, the wrong Sutherland constants, the
standard lapse used where a sounding existed, and a wind that stepped at the lowest forecast level.
RocketPy, the M2.1 oracle, interpolates everything linearly and ignores humidity. Several choices
had no single right answer and are recorded here.

**Decision.**

- **Height datum:** atmospheres and winds are queried with geometric height above mean sea
  level. The flight engine converts from ellipsoidal height with the site's geoid undulation.
  Every sample says whether the model extrapolated.
- **1976 standard:** implemented from its equations and constants: `R* = 8314.32`,
  `S = 110.4 K`, and `M/M₀` from 80 to 86 km, which the printed tables omit.
  - The committed fixture is transcribed from the scan and cross-checked by mpmath and
    `ambiance`.
  - Outside −5 to 86 km the lowest layer continues downward, and the air is isothermal above 86
    km. Both are flagged.
- **Temperature offsets:** `ΔT` is added at equal geopotential height, and pressure is
  integrated hydrostatically from a sea-level pressure. `anchored` fits both to a measured
  temperature and pressure.
  - Rejected: the aviation convention (offset at equal pressure altitude, ESDU 77022). It is
    equally hydrostatic, but it detaches the lapse rate from height. A launch-site measurement
    and a sounding are both keyed on height. The two differ by 0.38% in density at 3 km for
    +20 K.
- **Moist air:** an ideal mixture of dry air and water vapour.
  - Saturation vapour pressure is WMO-No. 8 eq. 4.B.1 over water at all temperatures, with no
    enhancement factor.
  - Water vapour `C_p = 4R*`.
  - Dry-air Sutherland viscosity.
  - Measured errors: density 0.047% against CIPM-2007, speed of sound 0.009% from the `C_p`
    choice, viscosity 2.1% at saturation and 30 °C. CIPM-2007 itself was rejected: it is valid
    only from 15 to 27 °C and from 600 to 1100 hPa.
- **Soundings:**
  - A profile takes its site's latitude and works in WMO geopotential height (eqs. 12.15–12.16),
    so its hydrostatics use the local normal gravity (±0.27% from `g₀`). The latitude-free
    geopotential was rejected: it is 0.1% off in pressure over 3 km at the equator and poles.
  - Temperature and humidity are linear in geopotential height, and pressure uses the
    temperature-shaped log form, which is exact for dry hydrostatic layers.
  - Given pressures must fall with height.
  - Omitted pressures are filled hydrostatically with virtual temperature.
  - Beyond the levels, the standard continues, anchored at the end level. Above the top, the
    vapour mole fraction is held and capped at saturation.
  - Geopotential heights convert with WMO-No. 8 eqs. 12.15–12.16 (latitude-dependent).
  - Rejected: linear-in-height pressure as RocketPy does it, which is up to 1.15% off between
    700 and 500 hPa.
- **Wind:**
  - Meteorological "from" directions, and ENU velocities.
  - `LayeredWind` defaults to speed-and-direction interpolation along the shorter arc, which
    keeps a veering wind's speed. A calm level takes the other level's direction.
  - `Components` interpolation reproduces RocketPy.
  - Beyond the end levels the end wind is held and flagged.
- **Turbulence:** Dryden spectra with MIL-F-8785C's scale-length convention (not
  MIL-HDBK-1797's halved transverse lengths).
  - Generated by the exact discretization of the shaping filters, not MIL-HDBK-1797's Euler
    filters, whose variance is biased by `1/(1 − aT/2)`.
  - `GustField` precomputes a realization so the integrator sees a pure function.
  - Medium/high-altitude intensities are caller-supplied: the specification gives them only as
    a graph.
- **Seeded generator:** `hpr_core::random::SeededRng` is xoshiro256++, seeded through SplitMix64,
  with Marsaglia–Bray polar normals. It is written in-house (about 60 lines) and checked bit for
  bit against `rand_xoshiro`, which is only a test dependency.
  - **Rationale:** seeded results must not change when a dependency updates, and a sampling
    crate can change its algorithm in a new release. It also keeps the pure core free of runtime
    dependencies.
  - **Frozen:** changing the algorithm, seeding or draw order needs an ADR.
  - **Portability:** the integer stream is the same on every platform. Normal deviates,
    turbulence and the atmosphere use the platform's `ln`, `exp` and `powf`, so those are
    bit-identical on one platform (the CLAUDE.md requirement) but may differ in the last bit
    across platforms.
  - **Serialized form:** checkpoints write the state as four `0x` hex strings, because JSON
    readers lose integers above 2⁵³.

**Consequences.**

- M1.6 must:
  - convert ellipsoidal height to height above sea level before calling the atmosphere or wind;
  - pick the gust field's path coordinate (distance through the air, or altitude) and how gusts
    start on the rail;
  - use the moist speed of sound and density for Mach and dynamic pressure.
- M2.1 cases against RocketPy need levels dense enough, or a linear-pressure compatibility
  option, and `Components` wind interpolation. RocketPy's Wyoming import converts heights with a
  radius only.
- M5.2 importers convert geopotential heights with the WMO formula, and clamp radiosonde
  humidity above 100% into `[0, 1]`.
- M6.1 reuses `SeededRng` for dispersions.

## ADR-005: Solid motors: statistics, consumption, grains, file models and the bundled catalog (2026-09-17)

**Context.** M1.3 builds `hpr-motor`. Loft's motor code went wrong in eight ways (lessons L36–L43):
one `.eng` block per file, lost delay markers, class letters off at band tops, the last sample as
burn time, a fixed midpoint CG with no inertia, unlicensed curves, loose impulse checks, and
header envelopes trusted over catalog data. RocketPy, the M2.1 oracle, has its own conventions.
Several choices had no single right answer (`docs/physics/motor.md`).

**Decision.**

- **Statistics:** total impulse integrates the straight-line curve exactly, from an implicit
  `(0, 0)`. Burn time follows NFPA 1125: between the 5%-of-peak crossings. Average thrust is total
  impulse over that burn time. This is ThrustCurve's glossary and its site code, which a committed
  fixture runs unchanged (hpr agrees to 1.8e-15 on the bundle); its statistics page words average
  thrust differently, and the difference is about 0.1% of impulse.
- **Impulse classes:** upper limits are inclusive (NAR: "5.01 to 10.0 N-sec" for `C`), from
  `1/8A` to `O`, and on to `Z` by doubling.
- **Consumption:** constant effective exhaust velocity, `m_p(t) = m_p0 (1 − I(t)/I)`. This is
  RocketPy's `SolidMotor` and ThrustCurve's `.rse` mass columns. It is an approximation (NASA
  SP-8039 shows `I_sp` drifting within a burn), recorded as such.
- **Propellant layout:** a fixed-shape column (the default, RocketPy's `GenericMotor` model) or
  BATES grains. The grain regression is solved exactly in burned mass instead of RocketPy's ODE in
  time. Motor mass, centre and inertias agree with RocketPy within 7.9e-5 relative.
- **Envelope default:** from a catalog entry alone, the propellant is a solid column and the dry
  mass a thin tube, both over the full length and centred. Crude, and documented as such; motors
  with data use `SolidMotor::new`. Catalog metadata overrides the curve file's header.
- **Steps:** equal consecutive times in a curve are a step, not an error; decreasing times,
  negative thrust, and curves with no impulse or no NFPA burn time are errors. ThrustCurve's code
  instead averages points under 50 µs apart: identical on every bundled curve, and up to 1.1% in
  average thrust on 17 of 1710 survey files, all with repeated times.
- **Grains** need a bore: a solid end burner isn't a BATES grain, and its regression differs.
- **Ambient pressure:** the full-flow term `(p_ref − p_a) A_e` applies strictly inside the burn,
  as in RocketPy's flight. It steps to zero at burnout and overstates tail-off thrust (about 1% of
  impulse in vacuum for a 38 mm reload with a known exit); COTS data gives no exit diameter, so
  it is off by default.
- **File models:** `.eng` and `.rse` keep the file's units and points exactly, so read-write-read
  cycles are bit-exact. Readers are lenient and return warnings; writers refuse anything the
  reader would read differently. Readers take `&str`; decoding bytes is `hpr-io`'s job.
- **Delays:** the raw string is kept; `P`, `100` and `1000` read as plugged, `0` is flagged as
  ambiguous.
- **Bundled catalog:** only curves ThrustCurve marks public domain, whose total impulse, burn time
  and average thrust each match ThrustCurve's stored values within 1%. That is 32 curves from B to
  O. Of 554 public-domain curves, 196 pass, so the rule leaves out 358. Most miss on burn time or
  average thrust, or their impulse is 1–5% off; the breakdown is in
  `docs/research/thrustcurve-data.md`. "Free" curves (which can be GPL) are never bundled.
- **Catalog metadata:** each bundled motor's published statistics and identifiers (names, class,
  type, dimensions, masses, impulse, thrust, burn time, delays, case) are copied from
  ThrustCurve's API into the committed index, with attribution. ThrustCurve states no terms for
  its metadata. These are facts about commercial products, mostly from certification bodies, for
  32 motors, and the milestone's 1% check and offline catalog need them. Recorded under "Needs
  Neer" (not blocking) to confirm; the fallback is to keep only the numbers the checks use, or to
  take them from manufacturers' data sheets.
- **XML:** `roxmltree`, a strict read-only parser that refuses DTDs; the `.rse` writer is
  hand-written.

**Consequences.**

- M1.4 places the motor's nozzle exit in the body frame and adds retainers with
  `with_added_dry_mass`.
- M1.6 takes mass, centre, inertias and `ṁ` from `SolidMotor::state`, and decides whether to
  apply the ambient-pressure thrust term (COTS files give no exit diameter).
- M2.1 feeds RocketPy only curves without an explicit `(0, 0)`: RocketPy prepends one, and the
  duplicate makes its impulse NaN. RocketPy's `GenericMotor.load_from_eng` uses the diameter as
  the chamber radius.
- M5 fetches the other curves into a cache and never bundles them.
